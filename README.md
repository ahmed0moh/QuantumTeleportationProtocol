# 🌀 Quantum Teleportation with Qiskit

This project is a basic implementation of the *Quantum Teleportation Protocol* using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), IBM's open-source quantum computing framework.  
It serves as a practical exercise to understand how quantum teleportation works at the circuit level.

## 📌 What is Quantum Teleportation?

*Quantum teleportation* is the transfer of quantum information (a qubit state) from one location (Alice) to another (Bob), using entanglement and classical communication — without physically sending the qubit itself.

It is not science fiction! It relies on quantum entanglement and measurement.

## 📜 Code Overview

The protocol involves three qubits:
- q0: The qubit to teleport (Alice's qubit)
- q1: Entangled with q2 (shared between Alice and Bob)
- q2: The target qubit (Bob's qubit)

Steps:
1. *Entanglement*: Create an EPR pair between q1 and q2.
2. *Encoding*: Alice performs a CNOT and Hadamard gate to entangle her qubit with the EPR pair.
3. *Measurement*: Alice measures her qubits and sends the classical bits to Bob.
4. *Decoding*: Bob applies conditional gates (X and Z) based on Alice’s measurement.
